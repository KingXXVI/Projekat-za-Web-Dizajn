                            after a month of working on other school stuff i have finally found the time to work
                            on this project again and was finally able to finish the footer with social media and
                            licence information. I havent actually registered this project under a licence because 
                            as it probbaly states in the footer this thing is not likeley to ever go online but i 
                            still wanted to put something in the footer. at first i made thre divs for the columns
                            and filled them with a couple links for the sutff that usually goes in the footer on a
                            website, and it looked like shown in the thumbnail but then i realized that i had done 
                            what i always do, went ahead with an idea that popped into my mind without thinking it
                            through because i didn't have anything to put in all those links. Now i had to think,
                            what was i going to put in the footer? i could probably put licencing info in there as
                            i just mentioned but i didn't want to register one so i just put some (hopefully) funny
                            text there instead then i added another div above that which will contain the links to
                            my social media which i didn't really have a lot of (part of the reason i made an 
                            instagram account if i'm being honest).

                            originally i had all the links be just text based but that looked really boring and clunky
                            so i instead spent about half an hour searching the web for some svg icons to put in the 
                            footer instead
